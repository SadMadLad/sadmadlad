## **Command Lines**

Collection of command lines that I learnt along the way.

- **Making Script Executable**
  <pre data-controller="code-highlight" data-code-highlight-language-value="bash" data-code-highlight-code-value='
    chmod +x filename.sh
  '></pre>
  and then file is executable like `./filename.sh`.
